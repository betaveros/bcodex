bcodex
======

A command-line utility in Haskell for converting between "encodings". Not character encodings like Unicode or latin1, things like bytes written in hexadecimal or the puzzlehunt classic A=1, B=2 cipher.

Originally named `codex`. The prefixed `b` is because I don't want to accidentally use up the name for some better projects by more professional people.

Example usages:

- `bcodex.hs alpha to numbers`
- `bcodex.hs chars to bytes`
